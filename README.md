# DuinoCoinI2C_RPI
This project design to mine [Duino-Coin](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin) using Raspberry Pi or equivalent SBC as a master and Arduino as a slave.

Using the I2C communication to connect all the boards and make a scalable communication between the master and the slaves.

## Python Environment Setup

### Linux

```BASH
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git i2c-tools python3-smbus -y # Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/JK-Rolling/DuinoCoinI2C_RPI.git # Clone DuinoCoinI2C_RPI repository
cd DuinoCoinI2C_RPI
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt # Install pip dependencies
````

Use `sudo raspi-config` to enable I2C. Refer detailed steps at [raspberry-pi-i2c](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-i2c/)

Finally, connect your I2C AVR miner and launch the software (e.g. `python3 ./AVR_Miner_RPI.py`)

### Windows

1. Download and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (add Python and Pip to Windows PATH)
2. Download [the DuinoCoinI2C_RPI](https://github.com/JK-Rolling/DuinoCoinI2C_RPI/releases)
3. Extract the zip archive you've downloaded and open the folder in command prompt
4. In command prompt type `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required pip dependencies

Finally, connect your I2C AVR miner and launch the software (e.g. `python3 ./AVR_Miner_RPI.py` or `py AVR_Miner_RPI.py` in the command prompt)

## Version

DuinoCoinI2C_RPI Version 2.73

# Arduino - Slave

All Slaves have the same code and should select the I2C Address automatically.


## Library Dependency

* [DuinoCoin](https://github.com/ricaun/arduino-DuinoCoin) (Handle the `Ducos1a` hash work)
* [ArduinoUniqueID](https://github.com/ricaun/ArduinoUniqueID) (Handle the chip ID)
* [StreamJoin](https://github.com/ricaun/StreamJoin) (StreamString for AVR)

## Automatic I2C Address 

The I2C Address on the Arduino is automatically updated when the board starts, if an Address already exists on the I2C bus the code finds another Address to use.
However, depending on vendor, some cloned Arduino have a pretty bad random number generator. It causes it to either wait too long or clashes with each other during address assignment.

Change the value on the define for each Nano for non-overlapping delay:
```
#define DEV_INDEX 1
```

# Raspberry PI or SBC - Master

The master requests the job on the `DuinoCoin` server and sends the work to the slave (Arduino).

After the job is done, the slave sends back the response to the master (SBC) and then sends back to the `DuinoCoin` server.

## Max Client/Slave

The code theoretically supports up to 117 clients on Raspberry PI

Slave addresses range from 0x3..0x77

**Note:** If you see bad shares, it could be due to a bug in [RPI I2C hardware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/254)

# Connection Pinouts

Connect the pins of the Raspberry PI on the Arduino like the table/images below, use a [Logic Level Converter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009) to connect between the SBC and Arduino.

|| RPI | Logic Level Converter | Arduino |
|:-:| :----: | :-----: | :-----: |
||3.3V | <---> | 5V |
||GND | <---> | GND |
|`SDA`| PIN 3 | <---> | A4 |
|`SCL`| PIN 5 | <---> | A5 |
